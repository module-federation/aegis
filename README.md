# Ã†GIS

See the [aegis-host](https://github.com/module-federation/aegis-host) repo for documentation and a working example of a federation server.

## Consolidate your microservices 
(by running them together in a single process)

- for decreased footprint,
- better performance and
- simpler operations

_without loosing_

- deployment independence,
- language independence
- or component independence (i.e. components remain decoupled)

## Or distribute your components
(across a self-forming service mesh)

- dynamically and adaptively
- outside the datacenter and beyond the edge

_with_

- non-functional, boilerplate code done for you
  - dynamically generated APIs and datasources
  - transparent integration and persistence
  - AI inference against streaming data in real time (AIoT)
  - dedicated thread pools supporting CPU-bound workloads
  - shared memory for efficient processing across threads
  - fast streaming using QUIC protocol and async I/0
  - in-process, self-forming service mesh supporting data federation and other application services.
  - autonomous self-administration (e.g. CA certs provisioned/renewed programmatically)
  - exhaustive portability: Aegis can run as a server, cluster, or serverless function, in the datacenter, at the edge, and beyond (browser, phone, drone, pi, eventually arduino)
- and capabilities that enhance the development experience
  - comprehensive, rapid deployment (deploy in seconds to any compute primitive: serverless, container, IoT, etc)
  - runtime binding and hot reload (e.g. add new functionality on the fly, switch from on-prem to cloud live)
  - zero downtime, zero installation, independent deployment--even for components running in the same process
  - Polyglot, portable, containerless, sandboxed, AoT-compiled modules run safely anywhere, at native speeds
  - decentralized, scalable, "tessellated" hexagonal architecture

### And do it all without deployment automation

You don't need that anymore.

## Git Setup

This repo was forked from the `github.com/module-federation/aegis`. The idea is to maintain a common git history with Aegis in Module Federation but without the fork relationship which removes any dependency in the BLI on the Module Federation repo but allows us to update this repo as well as contribute to the open source project seamlessly.

Remotes: 
  - origin -> `github.com/briteliteimmersive/aegis-core`
  - bli -> `github.com/briteliteimmersive/aegis` (fork of OSS)
  - oss -> `github.com/module-federation/aegis`

### Updating this repo from the OSS library

- `git pull oss main`

### Opening a PR in module-federation/aegis

- `git push bli <branch name>`
-  Open PR in BLI pointed to Module Federation
